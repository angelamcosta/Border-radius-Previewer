# Border-radius-Previewer

<p>Border-radius Previewer is an application created to solve the <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Border-Radius-Previewer.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Border-radius Previewer</a> challenge proposed by the <a href="https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Ideas Collection</a> repository. The application shows a box which has a border-radius property applied to it. You can change the 4 border-radius values that are applied to the box (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Once you reach the desired settings, you can copy properties to apply to your own projects.</p>
